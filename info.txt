We created components folder for the objects / files which are going to be used all over ex: header.js , navbar.js and footer.js

We created screens folder for the objects / files which are going to be displayed  ex: homepage.js , menu.js

We installed bootstrap 5 dark version for a dark themed website , and then went to bootstrap 5 navbar to choose what kind off navbar do we want  , and put the code in navbar return statement 

here rises a problem that everytime we switch to diffferent screens like home ,  menu , any navbar page the page is gonna reload because the code we copied for navbar it has href tags which originally works for opening it to a new page ( thats why it reloads )

to avoid that , since we need a single page website , we will implement REACT ROUTERS DOMS ENABLING DYNAMIC ROUTING IN WEB PAGES

mongoimport --uri mongodb+srv://prajeshkumar2603:Mcu%402004@cluster0.zulagwx.mongodb.net/DashDine --collection food_items --jsonArray --file "X:\workspace\DashDine\foodData2.json"

mongoimport --uri mongodb+srv://prajeshkumar2603:Mcu%402004@cluster0.zulagwx.mongodb.net/DashDine --collection food_catg --jsonArray --file "X:\workspace\DashDine\foodCategory.json"

isntalled express.js , nodemon ( only helps in devlopeer level no use at production level )  , mongoose

express helps syntax wise, will use nodemon for quick refresh 

what is moo=ngoose?
if we connect directy mongodb to node js  - code writing is complicated  , so mongoose makes it easier

mongo db is schema less , like even if we give wrong key and put some random shit  , mongo db wont get errors but we need a validation we will use mongoose
